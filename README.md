# ethtps_data_dump
python script that takes local json data from ethtps (https://api.ethtps.info/API/v2/AllData) and puts it into csv format.

Local copy of data is used, as it must first be reformatted (can use https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) 

Thank you @mister_eth for making this data available.
